Weekly report Software Engineering
Inside the class:
Week-1

1- Introduction of the Software Engieering and its course structure.
2- We had learned the importance of the quality product and the product must be affordable to all.
3- We had discussed about the game "Pokemon Go" and its pros and cons. We also came with some innovative ideas to improve the game in future.
4- We had seen the ideas of each individual for the same product as it was different from others

Week-2
 
1- We discussed on several new ideas and shared it in class which was damn exciting, innovative and also that we could develop in future.
2- We discussed mainly about the problem regarding software development.
3- We spent a lot of time discussing about the quality of product

Week-3

1- This week we came to know about what the software engineering is, why are we studying this and at what is the importance of same in future. 
2- We discussed about problem that we are facing while developing the software distribution and maintenance.
3- We have first learnt the user requirements and will try to design an optimized system design for the same. 
4- We have also discussed about choosing the languages and frameworks that world meet our requirements to develop the software.

Week-4

1- We have discussed about roles of a software engineer in a product making and the life cycle of a product as well.
3- We discussed about the requirement and its various uses in the products.
4- We had also discussed about Learnt defining relationships between requirement and other various aspects of a project.
5- We had Learnt how to represent real life problems in various ways.

Week-5

1- Many different models we studied today.
2- My personal vote will go for spiral model since the iterations changes the abstraction everytime.
3- Big debate on agile models. is comprehensive documentation good or we should focus more on final deliverables ?
4- Agile models(80%) + Unified processes(20%) = An amazing adaptive model
5- How to believe in someone else's code ? Will it affect the quality.
